# What is this project all about?

I'm trying to create a simple To-Do plugin for Obsidian because why not. This is my first time trying to create a plugin to Obsidian and first real touch into TypeScript. I'm following the API documentation.

## API Documentation

See https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api

# The current status

I can add notes, mark them and delete them individually etc, but they are not persistent.

1. Click on the star icon
2. Click on the add button
3. Add a To-Do
